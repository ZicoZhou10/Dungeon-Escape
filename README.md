## What it is?
The game is developed based on the Unity 3D engine and Ubiq VR collaboration package (By the UCL Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group)
A two-player VR room escape game. In the game, two players are locked in different rooms in an ancient dungeon full of traps. Players need to communicate through voice and collaborate remotely to complete a series of tasks.
Solve a series of puzzles and mechanisms, obtain the holy sword hidden in the dungeon, open the sealed door of the dungeon, defeat the dragon and escape from the dungeon. The core design of the game contains many classic elements of escape rooms. For example, password decryption, cooperative triggering mechanism, prop collection and unlocking, visual and sound effect prompt design, etc.
